## Adaptive Image Monitoring (AIM) Program

The Adaptive Image Monitoring (AIM) program is a collaborative initiative designed to enhance biodiversity data collection using remote camera traps positioned at unconventional angles. AIM employs science-based decision-making and standardized protocols to optimize camera placement across various scenarios, ensuring broader habitat and species coverage. By leveraging AI-driven algorithms, the program allows users to survey previously inaccessible or overlooked areas, offering deeper insights into species behaviour, population dynamics, and ecology. Integrated with WildTraxâ€™s remote camera sensors, AIM efficiently channels this data into efficient pipelines, enabling more consistent and reliable long-term species monitoring.
