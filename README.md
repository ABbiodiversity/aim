# Adaptive Image Monitoring (AIM) Program

The Adaptive Image Monitoring (AIM) program is a collaborative initiative focused on enhancing biodiversity data collection through the strategic placement of remote camera traps in diverse scenarios. By employing science-based decision-making and standardized protocols, AIM optimizes remote camera placement to increase habitat and species coverage, thereby providing deeper and more accurate insights into species behaviour, population dynamics, and ecology. Integrated with WildTraxâ€™s remote camera sensor, AIM efficiently channels this data into streamlined workflows, facilitating consistent and reliable long-term species monitoring.
